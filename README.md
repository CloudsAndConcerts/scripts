### About Clouds & Concerts

Clouds & Concerts concerns key challenges linked to the significance of music in contemporary society. Live and recorded music play different parts in this, not least in terms of public and private cultural activity. Festivals and streaming services represent key developments in these two realms, respectively, and are therefore empirical focal points in the project. We also want to explore the ways in which festivals and streaming services interact with users through social media, and how users use these services to share and explore live and recorded music.

We have singled out the Ã˜ya festival  as the main case for the project and are conducting an in-depth study of the relationship between actual music events and the mediated culture of sharing music surrounding the concert. The streaming service WIMP provides user data to be analysed by the project, and Telenor assists with data analyses.
